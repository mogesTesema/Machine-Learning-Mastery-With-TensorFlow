## 🚀 About This Repository  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning With TensorFlow** repository.  
This project is my personal learning lab — a collection of all the machine learning and deep learning projects I’ve completed while studying and experimenting with TensorFlow.  

Here, you’ll find a structured path through the foundations of machine learning — from simple regression tasks to advanced neural networks, transfer learning, and natural language processing.  
Each notebook represents a step in my growth as an ML engineer and is written with clarity and reproducibility in mind.

This repo is meant for:
- Learners who want to explore TensorFlow hands-on.
- Developers looking for working examples of ML models.
- Anyone interested in understanding how deep learning models are built and improved.

## 📘 Topics Covered  

- **TensorFlow Fundamentals** – Core TensorFlow operations, tensors, and model building basics.  
- **Regression** – Predicting continuous values using neural networks.  
- **Classification** – Binary and multi-class classification tasks.  
- **Computer Vision** – Image classification, CNNs, data augmentation, and transfer learning.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Text vectorization, embeddings, and sentiment analysis.  
- **Transfer Learning** – Using pre-trained models for feature extraction and fine-tuning.  
- **Helper Utilities** – `helper_functions.py` includes custom visualization and evaluation utilities.  

Each project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook with explanations, code walkthroughs, and model evaluation.

## 🌍 My Motivation

I built this repository to document my machine learning journey as a software engineering student and aspiring ML engineer.
The goal is to:

* Learn by building real projects.
* Practice model development, tuning, and evaluation.
* Build a portfolio of TensorFlow-based projects for future research and professional growth.

I believe mastery comes from practice, and this repository represents that continuous learning process.
